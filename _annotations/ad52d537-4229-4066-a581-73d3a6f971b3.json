The poem\u2019s speaker draws oblique attention to the length of lines in v. 8 (see below). In the 11th c. manuscript known as Codex S (Sangallensis 864), space is left for a drop capital that was never added. Its absence draws even more attention to the scribe\u2019s decision not to indent every other line of the elegiac couplet in the codex.",
